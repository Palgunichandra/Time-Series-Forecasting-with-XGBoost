# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-XGBoost
This repository demonstrates how to apply XGBoost for time series forecasting using Python.
It provides a step-by-step workflow covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation on temporal datasets.
📌 Project Overview

Time series forecasting is essential for predicting future values based on historical patterns.
This notebook showcases:

Handling and preparing time series data for machine learning

Feature engineering (lags, rolling statistics, time-based features)

Implementing XGBoost Regressor for forecasting

Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE/MAE

Visualizing predictions vs. actual values

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

**📊 Results**

Forecast plots comparing predicted vs actual values

Model accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)

Insights into temporal feature importance using XGBoost

**🔮 Future Improvements**

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / Optuna

Incorporating external covariates (weather, holidays, etc.)

Comparing with other models (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet)

Deployment as an API for real-time forecasting

scikit-learn

xgboost
